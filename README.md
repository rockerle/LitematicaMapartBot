A little helper extension for Masa's awesome [litematica mod](https://github.com/maruohon/litematica) so I don't have to attend my PC all the time when I want to build a mapart. 
Shoutout to [@Circuitbree](https://github.com/Circuitbree) who did most of the A-Star pathfinding implementation (iirc) and [MrBreakNFix](https://github.com/MrBreakNFix) who made something similar recently and remembered me about this project here.
Now I can upload it to github to free up some storage.

16 times speed up showcase. It took the bot around 45min to build the map. Time to restart multiple times and refilling the inventory manually in creative mode took less than additional minutes that are not recorded.
